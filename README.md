# HHS-Remake

This is a redesign of my home high school's website. Currently, the site is in need of major changes. As a user, I found the
design of the page to be really confusing. There are links all over the page, seemingly with no rime or reason, and some of them
lead to placeholder or blank pages.

My goals for this project are to:
  1) Clean up the design so that it is more intuitive to the user
  2) Make the design of the page more modern
  3) Learn to use SASS to make awesome CSS styles
  4) Implement Google Analytics so that administrators can access data without the need for a "hits" box on the bottom of the page

When I am finished, I plan to present my site to the superintendent of schools in hopes that he would like to use it rather
than the current site! With this in mind, I will be paying very close attention to detail as I am treating this as a production-level project.
