# Welcome to the new home of Hamilton Community School District

Or, at least I wish it was.

This is a redesign of my home high school's website. Currently, the site is in need of major changes. As a user, I found the
design of the page to be really confusing. There are links all over the page, seemingly with no rime or reason, and some of them
lead to placeholder or blank pages. It's very busy, and while all the information a stakeholder could want or need is visible on the home page, a lot of the signal is lost in the noise.

My goals for this project are to:
  1) Clean up the design so that it is more intuitive to the user
  2) Make the design of the page more modern
  3) Learn to use SASS to make awesome CSS styles
  
Technologies used in this project:
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * JavaScript
  * SASS (CSS preprocessor)
  * Bootstrap (CSS/JS framework)
  * Font-Awesome (awesome library of icons)
  * jQuery (JavaScript library

I am currently in a place where I am pretty happy with the home page; I have also included a few links from the home page that are working well. My next steps include building HTML versions of as many of the PDF files as I can (PDF's can be a pain to download on mobile), as well as working on more pages of the site.

When I finish this project, I plan to offer my services to the Superintendent of the district in exchange for a testimonial that I can use on my portfolio website.
